# springsecurity
This Spring Security repository has all my stuffs which i have implemented while learning spring security.

This repository has very basic examples, implemented in 3 ways
- XML configuration way
- JAVA configuration way
- Spring boot way

However i concentrated more on java configuration way of implementation in most of the examples. Even though i could have done all 3 ways of implementation for all examples unfortunately i haven't implemented for all examples.

While learning spring security, most of the concepts i understood by going through source code of spring security. And my understandings i noted and made available to myself by writing answers in stack overflow. You can find my well analysed answers on spring security in below given link.
